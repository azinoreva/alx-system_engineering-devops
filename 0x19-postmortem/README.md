stmortem Report: Server Outage on June 24, 2024

Issue Summary
Duration:

Start: June 24, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End: June 24, 2024, 17:30 UTC
Impact:
During the outage, our web application was completely inaccessible to users, affecting 100% of our user base. Users experienced a "503 Service Unavailable" error when attempting to access the service.

Root Cause:
The root cause was an unexpected overload on the database server due to a sudden spike in traffic coupled with an inefficient query that led to resource exhaustion.

Timeline
14:00 UTC - Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating high latency and error rates.
14:05 UTC - Engineering team notified via automated alert system.
14:10 UTC - Initial investigation began focusing on the web server performance.
14:20 UTC - Web server logs showed no anomalies; database server investigation initiated.
14:45 UTC - Database logs reviewed, noticing significant delays and timeouts.
15:00 UTC - Assumed root cause to be a recent deployment; deployment rolled back.
15:30 UTC - Rollback completed, but issue persisted.
16:00 UTC - Escalated to the database administration team.
16:30 UTC - DBA team identified an inefficient query causing high CPU and memory usage.
17:00 UTC - Query optimized and database performance improved.
17:30 UTC - Service fully restored, and monitoring confirmed stability.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a poorly optimized SQL query in our application that executed inefficiently under high traffic conditions. This led to CPU and memory exhaustion on the database server, causing it to become unresponsive and leading to the application being unable to serve user requests.

Resolution:
Once identified, the inefficient query was optimized by adding appropriate indexing and rewriting the query to be more efficient. Additionally, database configuration parameters were adjusted to better handle high traffic scenarios. After these changes, the database server performance returned to normal, and the web application became accessible to users.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements Needed:

Code Review Process: Enhance the review process to catch inefficient queries before they reach production.
Load Testing: Implement more rigorous load testing to identify performance bottlenecks under simulated high traffic.
Monitoring: Improve monitoring to detect inefficient queries and database performance issues earlier.
Database Optimization: Conduct regular database performance tuning and optimization.
Specific Tasks:

Implement Query Optimization Review:

Task: Add a mandatory query performance review step in the code review process.
Responsible: Engineering Manager
Deadline: July 15, 2024
Enhance Load Testing:

Task: Develop comprehensive load testing scenarios that mimic peak traffic conditions.
Responsible: QA Team Lead
Deadline: August 1, 2024
Upgrade Monitoring Tools:

Task: Integrate advanced database monitoring tools to identify and alert on inefficient queries.
Responsible: DevOps Team
Deadline: July 30, 2024
Conduct Database Tuning:

Task: Schedule monthly database performance tuning sessions.
Responsible: DBA Team Lead
Deadline: Ongoing, first session by July 10, 2024
By implementing these corrective measures, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure higher reliability and performance of our service.
