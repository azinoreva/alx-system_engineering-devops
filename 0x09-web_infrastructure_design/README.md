# Project Name: Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview
This project focuses on designing web infrastructures ranging from a simple setup to a more distributed and secure setup. The tasks involve whiteboarding diagrams and explaining various components of the infrastructure, such as servers, web servers, application servers, databases, load balancers, DNS records, firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring systems.

## Curriculum
The curriculum covers foundational concepts in web infrastructure design, including network basics, server concepts, DNS, load balancers, monitoring, databases, security measures like firewalls and SSL certificates, and high availability setups.

## Tasks
1. **Simple Web Stack**
   - Design a one-server web infrastructure with components like Nginx, MySQL, application server, and domain configuration.
   - Explain the role of each component and identify issues such as single points of failure and scalability limitations.

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**
   - Design a three-server web infrastructure with components including Nginx, MySQL, load balancer, and application server.
   - Explain the need for additional elements and the configuration of the load balancer.
   - Discuss the setup of a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster.

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**
   - Design a three-server web infrastructure with enhanced security measures like firewalls and SSL certificates.
   - Implement monitoring systems for data collection.
   - Discuss issues related to SSL termination, database write availability, and component uniformity.
